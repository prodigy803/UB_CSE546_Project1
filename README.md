# UB_CSE546_Project1
SUNY Buffalos CSE 546 Project 1 - Involving Creating of Environments and Simulating in Reinforcement Learning Patterns

- The file pjoshi6_assignment1.zip contains the consolidated scripts (which are documented) along with a jupyter-notebook that calls the defined classes and tests the different parameters.

- The script "Q_Learning_Environment_Final.py" contains the environment for Q-Learning, both the stochastic and deterministic variants.
- The script "DQ_Environment_Final.py" contains the environment for Double Q-Learning, both the stochastic and deterministic variants.

- The jupyter-notebook RL_Assignment_1_Part2_V6_Deterministic_Stochastic_Q_and_DQ.ipynb calls the scripts and renders the graphs, the environment for greedy actions (after training), etc.
